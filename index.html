      <h1>What is leather?</h1>
      <p>
        Leather is the byproduct of different animal products as well as the meat industry.
        The levels of leather make up different types of leather seen on shoes.
        <br>
        These include suede and full grain options.
        The three types covered today are going to be Suede, full grain, and corrected grain leathers.
        <br>
        <img src="img/Leather types.jpg" alt="Leather Diagram">
        <br>
        This diagram shows the different types of leather products produced by a hide of leather.
        Typically if you see a tag with "genuine leather" on a pair of shoes that is usually a sign of poor quality.
        <br>
        In the USA, what qualifies as "genuine leather" is typically left over leather bits molded together and glued.
        <br>
        As a whole you typically want products that show either what tannery they originate from, or their leather type.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>What types of leather should I look for?</h2>
      <p>
        <div id="full-grain">
          Leather comes in many different shapes and sizes. The types of leather available is endless,
          Either from the different animals available or exotic animals as well.
          <br>
          Full-grain leather is simply the name given to most leathers that are used which use the top chunk of leather
          which has the most tensile strength.
          <br>
          A large appeal to full-grain leather is the lack of uniformity. Often you can see the scars and imperfections
          present on most top-grain leather footwear.
          <br>
          One of the more coveted types of full-grain leathers available is calfskin. In this example we have boxcalf.
          <br>
          <img src="img/Boxcalf.jpg" alt="Boxcalf example">
          <br>
          Calfskin is considered a very high-end leather type which is known for its resilience,
          as well as its ability to attain a very attractive patina.
          <br>
        </div>
        <div id="suede">
          The next type of leather product is suede. Suede is a type of felted leather that is often used on dressier
          shoes and boots.
          <br>
          Suede is a fiberous material that while less water resistant and more fragile than full-grain, has it's own
          level of nicheness,
          <br>
          which gives most suede a richness as well as unique patina patterns.
          <br>
          <img src="img/Suede Boots.jpg" alt="Suede boots">
          <img src="img/Suede Patina.jpg" alt="Suede patina">
          <br>
          These two images show how suede develops a patina as well as variety of colors that normal suede can come in.
          <br>
        </div>
        <div id="corrected-grain">
          <img src="img/41751637485_d74dd9519e_b.jpg" alt="Solovair boots">
          <br>
          This pair of Solovair boots are corrected leather. This means that this pair is made up of top grain leathers
          that aren't
          <br>
          as desirable or may have been more scarred. This is also done to create a uniform look in the leather, but
          also decreases
          <br>
          the longevity of the boot as well as lowering its appeal amongst most leather aficionados.
          <br>
          While there is nothing wrong with corrected grain, you are sacrificing the patina and uniqueness that comes
          with traditional top grain.

      <h3>How should I take care of my footwear?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm glad you asked! there is a myriad of ways in which you could take care of your footwear, while there is no
        "one" option available,
        <br>
        However, there are some general guidelines to what works for your footwear based on formality and how the
        leather is tanned.
        <br>
        On the more formal end of footwear, things like <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002Q0C9NS?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_PPXHKR9KQFAT0M59Y292">Saphir's Renovator</a>
        and their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J8NT7C2?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_6EMDZ9MJ3F0MJDJFZ3Q8">Pate De
          Lux</a> line of wax are essential for
        <br>
        creating a nice shine to the shoe or boot as well as increasing its durability and water resistance.
        On more rugged shoes or boots
        <br>
        waxes or oils work best. The strongest of these tend to be <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZR3TR4?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_W8T2MRD7GEK1NXXYP9J6">Mink oil</a>
        and most waxes that the company of your chosen boot likes most.
      </p>
      <h4>What do I need to take care of my shoes?</h4>
      <p>
        <img src="img/Shoe brush.jpg" alt="Horsehair brush">
        <br>
        While owning a good pair of GYW footwear can be quite exciting, it is important that you take care of your
        investments from time to time.
        <br>
        This means have the right tools for the job. As a new owner of GYW footwear it is important you have a solid
        understanding of what each
        <br>
        item works as well as what it is doing to your leather. When you get your first pair of GYW shoes the most
        important tool at your disposal is
        <br>
        a good shoe brush. Horsehair is the most preferred type of shoe brush, but most work well. Next you'll need <a
          href="https://stridewise.com/best-boot-conditioners/">conditioner</a> as well as a good <a
          href="https://www.dontwasteyourmoney.com/best-shoe-polish/"> wax polish</a>.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h5>I have the products, now what?</h5>
      <p>
        Now that you have an idea of what everything does, we can start with our guide on how to take care of your
        investments.
        <br>
        Our <a href="https://youtu.be/BjbHxQXOU14">Guide</a> starts off with a good brushing of your pair of footwear.
        From here you apply your choice of conditioner to the shoe and allow it 10 mins or so to dry.
        <br>
        Once the conditioner is dried, you can brush it all off for a dull sheen. Once you've achieved your sheen you'll
        be able to apply your choice of wax polish.
        <br>
        There are a myriad of ways to do this, either using fire to melt the wax onto the shoe, water to add a mirror
        shine, or simply appling the wax without any added methods.
        <br>
        Once you've applied your wax you can either use a shammy to give it a high shine, or use a brush to add a more
        glossy texture to the shoe. Once you've done this,
        <br>
        you can repeat this process 2-3 times for more protection from the elements as well as increasing the shine on
        the shoe. Once you have finished waxing,
        <br>
        you can give the shoe a final brushing and you'll have finished taking care of your investments.
